/!\ IMPORTANT: Before opening issue

- Please update all of your packages. I won't investigate on the issue if you are on an old version.
- Please check that you have the same version for all Ts.ED dependencies (expected the logger). Many issues are related to a misconfigured packages.
- Please provide a reproducible example (avoid screenshot, prefer copy/pasted code). The stack trace isn't enough to investigate.

If these requirements aren't checked, I WON'T INVESTIGATE (excepted if you are a PREMIUM SPONSORS!) and issue will be CLOSED!
